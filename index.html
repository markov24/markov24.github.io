        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a first year CSE PhD at the University of Michigan advised by Prof. Maggie Makar. I am broadly interested 
          in the foundations of machine learning, with specific interests in causality and deep learning theory. In particular, 
          my work focuses on leveraging ML models to improve causal estimation and, in turn, using causal principles to better understand and advance modern ML methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Michigan, I completed a double major in computer science and mathematics at
          Northwestern University, where I worked on projects spanning robust machine learning,
          causal inference in natural language processing, and efficient transfer learning for
          large language models. After obtaining my PhD, my goal is to become a research scientist in industry.

        <h2>Current project</h2>
        <p>
          My current research project involves the design of an ML-based causal estimator that can produce consistent estimates
          even when standard assumptions do not hold. Overall, the goal is to understand what structural conditions in these models
          are necessary to retain a near-oracle estimation of the final causal effect. For this project, I combine both a theoretical 
          analysis together with controlled experiments to characterize these conditions, resulting in a reliable estimation procedure.
